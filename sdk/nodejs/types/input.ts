In the case of the masquerading method, the host address is usually an RFC 1918 private IP address, and the port can be different from that of the associated service. With the tunneling and direct routing methods, port must be equal to that of the service address. For normal services, the port specified in the service address will be used if port is not specified. For fwmark services, port may be omitted, in which case the destination port on the real server will be the destination port of the request sent to the virtual service.
